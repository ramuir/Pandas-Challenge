In the Heros of Pymoli challenge we looked at the sales distrubution
of an independent gaming company. All sales were additional purchases
to the video game called Heros of Pymoli.

From the data we can deduce that there are 576 different players and 780
different purchases. Several add ons were purchased multpile times, but to know
if this is effeicient we would need to know more about the cost of development
as it seems like this is a lot of add ons for how many were actually purchased mulitple 
times. The main driving sales was the male gender at 84% of users.

We also looked at the age distribution for the sales. the most common 
purchaser was between 20 and 24 and those within 15 to 29 years old 
purchased 77% of users from 5 to 50 years old.

Final Crite and Oathbreaker: Last Hope were the two most popular add ons at 
a $4.61 and $4.23 product cost and a $59.99 and $50.76 total revenue, respectively.
At a total revenue 2379.77 I see that even the most popular add ons are of a low
percentage of the total income. I would suggest to the company that it seems
better to produce more add ons than pricier harder to develop add ons. 
The power of abundance seems to be in their favor more so than just producing 
1 or 2 add ons that everyone purchases.
